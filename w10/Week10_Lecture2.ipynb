    "Today we're going to talk about how those lines of best fit are calculated and how we can use R to retrieve the formulas for them. The approach we use for this is called _bivariate regression_. The \"bivariate\" part is because we're just using two variables: a y-variable (vertical axis) and an x-variable (horizontal axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "How is this line calculated? This is a bit technical and I don't need you to remember this _exactly_, but I want to understand the basics: A bivariate regression line is formed by finding the line that minimizes the square of the vertical distances between the line and each of the points.\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember algebra? You can describe a line by $y = mx + b$. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Variable of Interest (y)} = \\text{Slope of line of best fit (m)} * \\text{Explanatory variable (x)} + \\text{Y-Intercept of line of best fit (b)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The y-intercept is at what value of y the line crosses the y-axis; i.e., the value of the line when x is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope is how much the line \"rises\" for every unit of increase in x.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ymxb.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this picture has a slope of 0.5 and an intercept of 1. The formula for this line is therefore $y = 0.5 * x + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we can use this formula to figure out where the line is (that is, what the value of y will be) for any value of x we give it. For example, where is the line when x = 5? $0.5 * 5 + 1 = 3.5$. And sure enough, that is what we see on the graph.\n",

    "### Getting the formula for the line of best fit in R\n",
