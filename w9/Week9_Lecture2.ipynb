    "Earlier this week, we learned about how to look at *levels* of variables. For example, what percent of people support repealing the ACA?\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will examine *descriptive hypotheses*, which are hypotheses about differences between groups. For example, you might be interested in asking: did people in California or in Texas support repealing the ACA at higher rates? These questions are *not* causal. For example, we wouldn't be testing whether taking a person and moving them from California to Texas would *cause* them to be more likely to support ACA repeal. We're just interested in whether the people who currently live in California and Texas have different opinions on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good news: It turns out that we've already learned everything we need to do this. We just have to think about what we're doing a bit differently than we did when we were running experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use `difference_in_means()` to estimate a difference between two groups.\n",
    "    - The basic formula is nearly identical. The formula is `difference_in_means(outcome ~ group.variable.name, data = dataset.name, weight = weight.variable.name)`. In this example, `group.variable.name` and `weight.variable.name` are two columns in a dataset called `dataset.name`.\n",
    "    - We don't need to supply `condition1` or `condition2` when the group variable is 0/1. `difference_in_means()` assumes we want to look at how much higher/lower the group where `group.variable.name == 1` is relative to the group where `group.variable.name == 0`.\n",
