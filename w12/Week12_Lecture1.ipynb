    "- If there is a control group in the experiment, it is usually the omitted category in a regression. That appears to be the case here, as the other groups all show up in the regression but the control group doesn't. So, we can interpret the results as effects relative to the control group.\n",
    "- As usual in regression tables, each column in the Table below reports a separate regression. What do the columns mean? In this case, we can see that each column has a different outcome measure, also known as \"dependent variable\".\n",
    "    - Let's focus on the first column as an example. We can see that the outcome for the first column is \"Total displays\", which the Table note helpfully tells us is the number of visible posters, brochures, \"sold here\" signs, flipcharts, condom dispensers, and certificates visible in the shot. This means the first column reports the results of running a regression where \"total displays\" is the outcome.\n",
    "- Each of the rows in the main body of the table show you coefficients and, below, standard errors.\n",
    "- The stars next to the coefficients tell us whether the results are statistically significant and at what level.\n",
    "- What is \"Controls: Yes\"? You sometimes see this: instead of printing all the control variables (since we're not really interested in them and they don't have a causal interpretation -- they are just for precision), in experiments, we save space by just noting controls are included. Elsewhere in the article it says what the controls are. Remember: when analyzing experiments with regression, we don't care about what the coefficients on the control variables are, we just sometimes include them in case they might help increase the precision of our estimates."
