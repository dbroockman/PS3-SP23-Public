    "\n",
    "There is a danger with heterogenous treatment effects, often called $p$-hacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of $p$-hacking is that, if you test lots and lots of hypotheses that are not true (i.e., where the null hypothesis is true), you're likely to get at least one statistically significant result just by chance. In fact, a $p$-value of 0.05 means there is a 1 in 20 chance that the result might have occurred my chance --- so it makes sense that if you test 20 different hypotheses, you'll likely get one statistically significant result even if none of the hypotheses you're testing are true!\n",
    "\n",
    "This xkcd cartoon I've showed previously makes this point:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"significant.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**$p$-hacking is when you test so many hypotheses that you become _very_ likely to get a statistically significant $p$-value for a null hypothesis that is true** --- i.e., to reach a $p$-value that incorrectly leads you to reject a true null hypothesis (e.g., thinking a treatment had an effect that actually has no effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "I bring this up during our discussion of heterogenous treatment effects because $p$-hacking is a _particularly_ big risk when examining heterogenous treatment effects, because in many datasets there are a ton of different subgroups you can slice and dice your dataset into. This can result in a situation where researchers think or convince others than, even if a treatment doesn't work overall, if you look at a specific group it does. Whenever you hear a claim like this, you should worry about $p$-hacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _New York Times_ did a nice story called \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/magazine/a-failure-to-heal.html?smid=pl-share\" target=\"_blank\">A Failure to Heal</a>\" about how this happens in medicine, especially drug development. When a drug in testing fails to have an effect...\n",
    "\n",
    "> a second instinct takes over: Why not try to find the people for whom the drug did work? ...\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This kind of search-and-rescue mission is called “post hoc” analysis. It’s exhilarating — and dangerous. On one hand, it promises the possibility of resuscitating the medicine: Find the right group of responsive patients within the trial group — men above 60, say, or postmenopausal women — and you can, perhaps, pull the drug out of the rubble of the failed study.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> But it’s also a treacherous seduction. The reasoning is fatally circular — a just-so story. You go hunting for groups of patients that happened to respond — and then you turn around and claim that the drug “worked” on, um, those very patients that you found. (It’s quite different if the subgroups are defined before the trial. There’s still the statistical danger of overparsing the groups, but the reasoning is fundamentally less circular.) It would be as if Sacks, having found that the three long-term responders to L-dopa happened to be 80-year-old women from one nursing home, then published a study claiming that the drug “worked” on Brooklyn octogenarians.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Perhaps the most stinging reminder of these pitfalls comes from a timeless paper published by the statistician Richard Peto. In 1988, Peto and colleagues had finished an enormous randomized trial on 17,000 patients that proved the benefit of aspirin after a heart attack. The Lancet agreed to publish the data, but with a catch: The editors wanted to determine which patients had benefited the most. Older or younger subjects? Men or women?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Peto, a statistical rigorist, refused — such analyses would inevitably lead to artifactual conclusions — but the editors persisted, declining to advance the paper otherwise. Peto sent the paper back, but with a prank buried inside. The clinical subgroups were there, as requested — but he had inserted an additional one: “The patients were subdivided into 12 ... groups according to their medieval astrological birth signs.” When the tongue-in-cheek zodiac subgroups were analyzed, Geminis and Libras were found to have no benefit from aspirin, but the drug “produced halving of risk if you were born under Capricorn.” Peto now insisted that the “astrological subgroups” also be included in the paper — in part to serve as a moral lesson for posterity. I’ve often thought of Peto’s paper as required reading for every medical student.\n",

    "Beware of this instinct! It can be a good idea to check if a treatment has different effects for different groups, but $p < 0.05$ is a lot less meaningful when you've tested many hypotheses."
