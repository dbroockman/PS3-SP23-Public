But we're usually interested in *generalizing* from experiments across all these dimensions:\n",

    "- *People*: Would the effects of the \"both\" condition among Utah Republican precinct chairs be similar to the effects for Utah Democratic precinct chairs? How about precinct chairs in other states?\n",
    "- *Time/Context*: The social pressure experiment we analyzed in Week 5 was conducted in an off-year primary election (e.g., imagine a 2021 primary election for Berkeley mayor). Would the effects be different in a Presidential general election (e.g., Biden versus Trump in 2020)?\n",
